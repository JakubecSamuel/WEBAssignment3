# Third Web Technologies 2 assignment
## ⚡Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS⚡
This is the third assignment from the Web Technologies 2 class. In this assignment I created a simple local Pong game.
I am able to choose between 2, 3 and 4 players. If someone scores a goal it also increments by one next to their paddle.
## This project had a deadline so there may appear some bugs because of the time limit and my knowledge at that time
